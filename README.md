# ARAM Rivals
### ARAM stats tracker, most recent match analyzer

## Setup
We want to install Pipenv through with homebrew: `brew install pipenv` because of the following reasons: https://pipenv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

Also, the tutorial recommends that a virtual environment is used (see Django documentation: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.0/topics/install/#installing-official-release").

1. Create a new virtual environment by running: `pipenv --three`
2. Install Django and Django REST framework by running: `pipenv install django djangorestframework`
3. After installation ends, spawn a shell within the virutal environment by running: `pipenv shell`

python will refer to python3 when executing commands like: `python manage.py runserver`
